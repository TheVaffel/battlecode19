# Battlecode App


Built in react, using modified template from http://creative-tim.com. Install with `npm install`, dev with `npm run start`, and build for prod with `npm run build`.  Fully static frontent, and interfaces with backend API via AJAX calls in `api.js` (TODO). 

Intent is to integrate dev environment/IDE into this using [Firepad](https://github.com/firebase/firepad) for collaboration and code storage, and [Coldbrew](https://github/joshuagruenstein/coldbrew) for testing.
