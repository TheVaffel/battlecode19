# Battlecode App


Built in react, using modified template from http://creative-tim.com. Install with `npm install`, dev with `npm run start`, and build for prod with `npm run build`.  Fully static frontend, and interfaces with backend API via AJAX calls in `api.js` (TODO). 

When installing a new Node package, always `npm install --save <package>` or `npm install --save-dev <package>`, and commit `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

NOTE: Requires the `coldbrew` package to work, located in `..`.  You can set this up by running `npm link` in `../coldbrew`, then `npm link coldbrew` in this directory.
