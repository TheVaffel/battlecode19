                                    <p>In the distant future, almost all nature and technology have been wiped out by global catastrophe.  All that remains are two opposing factions of <i>microbots</i>, <span className="text-danger">red</span> and <span className="text-info">blue</span>, who live on  a wraparound grid randomly scattered with holes and obstacles.  Microbots start with 64HP, and are given a randomly generated integer ID at creation.  The map starts with ~6-12 microbots per team, and is sized between 16x16 and 32x32.  Maps always have an even width and height, and are radially symmetric.</p>
                                    <p>In each turn a microbots can either move, attack a nearby microbot, or deploy a fuse to <bold>explode</bold> in 3 rounds.  Bots can also communicate using up to 4 bits of signalling.  Microbots have limited vision; they can only see within a surrounding 7x7 region, and cannot view the health of other microbots.</p>
                                    <p>When a microbot explodes, nearby squares also receive damage.  Bots up to 5 squares away (in manhattan distance) will receive 6 - their manhattan distance of damage.  For example, a bot next to the explosion will receive 5HP damage.</p>
                                    <p>Microbots can heal and reproduce through the joint formation of nexi.  If at the end of the round any 2 microbots of the same team have exactly one space between them, and both aim their nexus creation at the same square, then a new microbot of that team will be created in the center square with 1HP.  If a microbot already exists in the spot, itâ€™s health will be increased by 1HP.</p>
                                    <p>The game ends when either one team is totally annihilated, or 200 rounds have passed.  After 200 rounds, the team with greater total HP wins.  If both teams have equal HP after 200 rounds, the winner is determined by a coin flip.</p>

                                    <p>Javascript is the primary language supported by Battlehack West, and the target all other languages are compiled to, so it's a great choice to develop a bot in (especially for beginners).  Below is a bare minimum bot example:</p>
                                    <pre>{`class MyRobot extends BCAbstractRobot {
    turn() {
        return this.move(bc.NORTH);
    }
}`}</pre>
                                    <p>The main container of your bot code is the <code>MyRobot</code> class, which must be a subclass of <code>BCAbstractRobot</code>. <code>BCAbstractRobot</code> contains all sorts of useful methods that will make developing your bot easier.</p>
                                    <p>When your bot is spawned, a <code>MyRobot</code> object is created in its own global scope.  For every turn, the <code>turn()</code> method of your class is called.  This is where the heart of your robot code lives.  At the end of the <code>turn()</code> method, if you want to perform an action (move or attack), you must return <code>this.move(direction)</code> or <code>this.attack(direction)</code>, where <code>direction</code> can be <code>bc.NORTH</code>, <code>bc.SOUTHWEST</code>, or any similarly formatted direction.</p>

                                    <p>There are a number of useful methods you can use to explore and impact the world around you as a bot.  We'll detail them here.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><code>this.me()</code>: Returns an object containing details about your bot, including <code>.health</code>, <code>.id</code>, <code>.x</code>, <code>.y</code>, <code>.fuse</code>, <code>.signal</code>, and <code>.team</code>.</li>
                                        <li><code>this.log(message)</code>: Print a message to the command line.  You cannot use ordinary <code>console.log</code> in Battlehack for security reasons.</li>
                                        <li><code>this.signal(integer)</code>: Set your signal bits to a certain value 0 to 15 inclusive.</li>
                                        <li><code>this.getRobot(id)</code>: Returns a robot object with the given integer ID.  Returns null if such a robot is not in your vision.  This contains all the properties of <code>this.me()</code> except <code>.health</code>, assuming the gotten robot is not you.</li>
                                        <li><code>this.getVisibleRobots()</code>: Returns a list of all robot objects visible to you.</li>
                                        <li><code>this.getVisibleMap()</code>: Returns a 7x7 2d int array of your robot's current vision, where a value of <code>bc.EMPTY</code> means there's nothing there, <code>bc.HOLE</code> means the square is impassable, and if the value is neither hole or empty, the ID of the robot occupying that space.</li>
                                        <li><code>this.getRelativePos(dX,dY)</code>: A shortcut to get what's in the square <code>(dX,dY)</code> away.  Returns a robot object if one is there, otherwise <code>bc.EMPTY</code> or <code>bc.HOLE</code>.</li>
                                        <li><code>this.getInDirection(direction)</code>: Returns the output of <code>this.getRelativePos</code> in the specified direction.</li>
                                        <li><code>this.move(direction)</code>: Returns an action to move in a given direction.</li>
                                        <li><code>this.attack(direction)</code>: Returns an action to attack in a given direction.</li>
                                        <li><code>this.fuse()</code>: Returns an action to explode in 3 rounds.  You cannot move or attack once you've lit your fuse.</li>
                                        <li><code>this.nexus(direction)</code>:  Point Nexus creation in a given direction.  Does not have to be returned, and can be performed in synchrony with another action.</li>
