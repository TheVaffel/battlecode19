It's officially three months since the Battlecode 2018 [final tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdljkowowC4), and the devs are finally starting to wake out of hibernation.  This season was certainly our most challenging yet, with an unprecedented number of registrations, a 60% green development team, and a tech stack we decided to completely rewrite only weeks before the competition launch.  Nonetheless, competitors and sponsors alike seemed to have a great time, and to my knowledge no devs have been (permanently) psychologically scarred by the ordeal.

I'd like to use this post to address some competitor feedback we received during and after the season, and provide some insight as to the direction Battlecode will be heading in 2019.

1. __Docker__.  This was a mistake.  Rest assured that you will not need Docker to compete in Battlecode 2019, and that user install experience will be a top priority for whatever replaces it.  We'll be putting out a postmortem shortly that discusses our 2018 stack in greater technical detail.
2. __Multiple languages__.  We liked this, and competitors did too; just over 50% of competitors used Python, with another ~35% using Java and the rest C/++.  Expect to see support for multiple languages in next year's competition.
3. __Single Actor__.  Unlike previous Battlecode years, for this game one program controlled all bots on a given team.  People seemed to like both models, so expect that detail to only be revealed during next year's kickoff.
4. __Eligibility__.  Battlecode is an incredible community, and we're passionate about any way we can encourage more participation.  That's why we'll definitely be taking a good look at eligibility rules for next season, particularly those regarding international, post-graduate, and pre-college competitors.

We're hoping to update this blog fairly regularly with more Battlecode scoops, so watch out for hot tips and dev experience.
